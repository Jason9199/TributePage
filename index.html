    <section>Craig Groeschel (born December 2, 1967) is the founder and senior pastor of Life.Church (pronounced Life Church) which is considered the largest church in the United States with twenty five locations in seven states. He is married to Amy and have six children. They live in Edmond, Oklahoma, a suburb of Oklahoma City, where Life.Church is based.</section>

    <section>In 1996, Groeschel and a handful of people started Life Covenant Church in a two-car garage. He later told Business Week that he started the process by performing market research of non-churchgoers and designed his church in response to what he learned. Groeschel’s non-traditional style was successful and attendance of Life Covenant grew rapidly, eventually evolving to become (as of April 2013) the second largest church in the United States with twenty four Life.Church campuses. Groeschel began using video to deliver some of his sermons, when his fourth child was born in 2001 and he was unavailable for the Sunday service, discovering that the videos were popular with his churchgoers. In 2006 he set up a website called Mysecret.tv as a place for people to confess anonymously on the Internet. Groeschel also began delivering his services to the Second Life virtual world on Easter Sunday 2007.

Life.Church was named America’s Most Innovative Church by Outreach Magazine in 2007 and 2008. Life.Church innovations include its free resource library with sermons, transcripts, videos, artwork, and a digerati team that develops free software like ChurchOnlinePlatform.com and YouVersion the Bible app, which has been downloaded over 200 million times by December 2015.

According to Newsmax website, Life.Church is listed on the top 50 churches of America in 2015, being the largest church with an aproximate 100,000 people weekly attendance.</section>
